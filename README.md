# UserPurchase-PySpark
User Purchase Analysis with PySpark
This project demonstrates how to use PySpark for analyzing user purchase data. By leveraging PySpark, we can efficiently process and analyze large datasets, perform CRUD operations, and visualize the results using Python libraries like Matplotlib.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze user purchase data, perform various data processing tasks, and visualize the results. This involves:

Loading and processing purchase data.
Performing CRUD operations on the data.
Computing total sales per product category.
Visualizing the results using bar charts and pie charts.
Identifying key insights such as the product category with the highest sales and the most recent purchase date.
Aggregating and visualizing purchase amounts over time.
Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Apache Spark
PySpark library
Pandas library
Matplotlib library
CRUD Operations
Create: Add new records to the DataFrame.
Read: Display the DataFrame contents.
Update: Modify existing records (e.g., increasing the purchase amount by 10%).
Delete: Remove records based on conditions (e.g., removing purchases with an amount less than or equal to 100).
